Python script to avoid headache of downloading subtitles manually for movies and tv shows

This script help you add folder to list which this script make use to find out files which need subtiles.
it automatically download subtitles for new files added in folder. so if you download movies or tv shows 
and want to get subtitles without headache just use this script.

For subtitles this script make use of subliminal so sublimal must be installed alongside python 2.7 to work.
Right now this script is not fully functioning. I working hard to make it fully functional. Sorry right now it works
only on linux and in upcoming days going to work it too on windows. 


To run this python script you have to clone this git repo (seems boring or tedious but it is for a while) 
and you have to run main.py file using python main.py and don't forget to change your terminal to it's directory.
